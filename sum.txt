the cta on friday morning plans to open the northern terminal of the 95th street red line station, marking the substantial completion of the most costly station project in the agency’s history. the $280 million project replaces the original 50-year-old rail and bus terminal at the southern end of the red line, which runs along the dan ryan expressway. the station, one of the busiest on the cta system, serves 20,000 daily commuters and sees about 1,000 cta, pace and greyhound bus trips on an average weekday, cta officials said. the four-year station construction was also a necessary step in building the extension of the red line south to 130th street, which is part of the agency’s long-range plan. “this is a huge, huge accomplishment for the city of chicago and the far south side,” said ald.
