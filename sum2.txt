at nine o'clock on the morning of september 11th 2001, president george bush sat in an elementary school in sarasota, florida, listening to seven-year-olds read stories about goats. “night fell on a different world,” he said of that day. and on a different america. at first, america and the world seemed to change together. “we are all new yorkers now,” ran an e-mail from berlin that day, mirroring john f. kennedy's declaration 40 years earlier, “ich bin ein berliner”, and predicting le monde's headline the next day, “nous sommes tous américains”. and america, for its part, seemed to become more like other countries. al-qaeda's strikes, the first on the country's mainland by a foreign enemy, stripped away something unique: its aura of invulnerability, its sense of itself as a place apart, “the city on a hill”. two days after the event, president george bush senior predicted that, like pearl harbour, “so, too, should this most recent surprise attack erase the concept in some quarters that america can somehow go it alone.” francis fukuyama, a professor at baltimore's johns hopkins university, suggested that “america may become a more ordinary country in the sense of having concrete interests and real vulnerabilities, rather than thinking itself unilaterally able to define the nature of the world it lives in.”
both men were thinking about foreign policy. but global terrorism changed america at home as well. because it made national security more important, it enhanced the role of the president and the federal government.
